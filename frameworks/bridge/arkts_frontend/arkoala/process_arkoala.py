# Description
#
# This script is invoked by the build system and does not need to be executed directly by the developer.
# First, it checks if --release is provided as an argument. This is the only allowed type for stateMgmt
# that is included in the build image. It then verifies if the node_modules folder exists. If not, npm
# install is executed. Afterward, npm run build_release is performed, which also generates generateGni.js
# The files_to_watch.gni file contains a list of input files from tsconfig.base.json. When any of these
# files are modified, the build system triggers this script to regenerate stateMgmt.js.
